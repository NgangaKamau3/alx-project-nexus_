# ProDev Frontend Developer Learnings – ALX Program

## Overview
This repository documents my learnings and progress in the **ALX ProDev Frontend Developer Program**.  
The program is designed to build strong, industry-relevant skills in frontend development while encouraging problem-solving, collaboration, and best practices in software engineering.

Although the broader ProDev initiative also covers backend engineering, mobile development, and system design, my focus is on **Frontend Engineering** — mastering modern tools and frameworks that power interactive, user-friendly web applications.

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered
- **Mobile Development** with React Native & Expo. Extending web skills to mobile platforms.
- **Web Development** with React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS - Building scalable and responsive web applications.
- **Progressive Web Applications (PWA)** development - Combining web and mobile capabilities for offline-first experiences.

---

### Frontend Development Concepts
- **Next.js** – Server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for fast UI development.
- **TypeScript** – Adding static typing for maintainable and scalable code.
- **GraphQL** – Query language for APIs enabling efficient data fetching.
- **API Integration** – Connecting frontend with backend services.
- **System Design & Analysis** – Structuring applications for scalability and maintainability.  
- **State Management** with Redux and Context API  
- **Error Handling** strategies for resilience and stability
- **Version Control (Git & GitHub)** – Best practices for collaboration and open-source contribution.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Styles not reflecting properly in React Native.  
  **Solution:** Debugged configuration in `babel.config.js` and ensured Tailwind setup was correctly linked.

- **Challenge:** Conflicting peer dependencies in npm packages.  
  **Solution:** Resolved by carefully reviewing peer dependencies and aligning versions with Expo SDK.

- **Challenge:** Understanding types implementation and using some Tailwindcss styles
  **Solution:** I watched build session to gain insight, I read the docs

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- Write **clean, reusable, and modular code**.
- Use **version control effectively** (branches, pull requests, and commit messages).
- Prioritize **performance and accessibility** when building interfaces.
- Embrace **problem-solving and research** — errors are opportunities to learn.
- Stay **consistent with coding standards** and documentation for maintainability.
- Collaboration, communication, and attention to detail are as important as coding itself.
